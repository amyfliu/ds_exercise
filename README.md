Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups. Each year, about 659,000 people die of heart disease -that will be 1 in every 4 deaths (Virani SS et al., Circualtion 2021). For this exercise you will use dataset “HD.csv” to develop a model for predicting heart disease.
